# irrigationControl
You know what really grinds my gears? When I have a sprinkler leak in the back yard. I can then be witnessed running sprints between the leak location and the irrigation controller as I determine the general location, exact location, then location after pipe has been exposed, then flushing the system, then testing the repair, etc. This app-controlled setup makes for a lot less work and a lot less mud.
